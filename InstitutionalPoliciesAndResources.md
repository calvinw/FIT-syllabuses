# Institutional Policies and Resources

### COVID-19 Updates
While wearing masks is not mandatory, it is always available as an option for those who wish to wear one. To stay updated on current protocols, please bookmark [this page](https://www.fitnyc.edu/campus-return/current-status.php).

### Academic Honor Code
FIT's Academic Honor Code is enforced in this course. Students who copy another person's idea or written work and claim it as original would be in violation of academic integrity. See [Academic Honor Code Policy](https://www.fitnyc.edu/about/policies/academic-affairs/academic-honor-code.php) for further details.

### Withdrawal Procedures
The last day to officially withdraw from a course is up until the last day of the 13th week of a fall or spring semester, the 9th day in a winter term, and until the 13th day in a summer term. The student will receive a final grade of WD for a course withdrawal completed in this time frame. WD grades do not affect GPA.

To officially withdraw from a course, students must submit a Course Withdrawal Form, completed and signed by them and their instructor, and submitted to the Registrar's Office in the Feldman Center, Room C158. If you stop attending classes without completing the official course withdrawal process you will receive a WF grade, which is equivalent to an F grade.

See [Course Withdrawal Procedures](https://www.fitnyc.edu/academics/courses-and-registration/registrar/course-withdrawal.php)

### Emergency Preparedness
FIT is committed to ensuring the safety and security of the FIT community and campus. The College's Emergency Management Plan provides direction for how to respond to major events and provides information about how to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate injury and damage.

Students are expected to refrain from conduct that threatens or endangers the health, safety, and welfare of the FIT community. See the [Code of Student Conduct Policy](https://www.fitnyc.edu/documents/policies/em003-code-of-student-conduct.pdf) for further details.
