# Vibe Coding Experiments with Google Gemini 

## Overlapping SVGS and Showing Gemini a Screenshot 

Ask Gemini to edit some html with you. Get an html Canvas editor window.

Delete everything that is there and paste in the following svg code:

```svg
<svg width="400" height="400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <circle cx="200" cy="200" r="150" fill="yellow" />
  <rect width="200" height="150" x="30" y="30" rx="16" ry="16" fill="blue" />

  <ellipse cx="100" cy="200" rx="100" ry="100" fill="cyan" />

</svg>
```

Now ask Gemini to move the shapes around so they touch but do not overlap.  
You can try to show Gemini what the picture looks like by making a screenshot and pasting that into gemini chat window. Tell the LLM that it is what the svg code
currently shows and it needs to fix it so that the shapes do not overlap
