## Step 1: Create a Dolt Account

Visit [https://www.dolthub.com](https://www.dolthub.com) and click the "Sign Up" button. Fill in your email address and create a password. You'll receive a verification email to confirm your account.

Once verified, you'll have access to all Dolt features including the ability to create and manage databases.

---

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Profile

Once logged in, go to [https://www.dolthub.com/profile](https://www.dolthub.com/profile) to access your dashboard. This is where you can manage all your databases and repositories.

---

## Step 3: Create a New Database

On your profile page, click the **"Create Database"** button. Choose a name for your database (for example: "simple-orders-and-products"). Provide a description if desired, then click **"Create"**.

Your new database will be created and you'll be taken to the database homepage.

---

## Step 4: Generate Complete SQL Script

Prepare all your database information:

- Table descriptions and structure
- Sample data for each table
- Paste everything into an LLM (like Gemini or Claude)
- Have the LLM generate ONE complete SQL script with both CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements

---

## Step 5: Upload and Run SQL Script

Once you have your complete SQL script from Gemini:

1. Copy and paste the script into [SQL File Save Utility](https://gemini.google.com/share/25c00e5399fc) and save it to your hard drive as `create_database.sql` or similar.
2. Go to your database on Dolt
3. Click the **"Add"** menu on the far right
4. Choose **"Upload a file"**
5. Select your SQL file and upload it
6. The script will execute, creating all tables and inserting data on a branch. 

---

## Step 6: Merge the Changes

The changes are placed on a **branch**, not on the main branch. To commit your changes to the main branch:

1. After uploading the script from Gemini and it executes, navigate to the **"Jobs"** section
2. Look for **"Pull Request #1"** (or similar)
3. Click on the pull request to open it
4. Look for the **"Merge"** button
5. Click **"Merge"** to merge your changes from the temporary branch to the main branch

## Step 7: Check Your Changes on the Main Branch 

1. **Refresh the whole repo webpage** - changes don't always appear right away
2. Your tables and data are now permanently saved on the main branch

## Example Complete SQL Script (from Gemini)

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em;"}
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  in_stock TINYINT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id INT,
  customer VARCHAR(100),
  qty INT,
  completed TINYINT,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

INSERT INTO products VALUES (1, 'Wireless Headphones', 79.99, 1);
INSERT INTO products VALUES (2, 'Coffee Beans', 14.99, 1);

INSERT INTO orders VALUES (101, 1, 'Alice', 2, 1);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (102, 2, 'Bob', 5, 1);
```

## Query Your Data

Now you can query your data

Use SELECT statements to view your data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE completed = 1;

SELECT p.name, COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

## Primary Keys

A **Primary Key** is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Every row must have a unique primary key value, and it cannot be NULL.

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
| product_id | name | price | in_stock |
|------------|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Wireless Headphones | 79.99 | 1 |
| 2 | Coffee Beans | 14.99 | 1 |
| 3 | T-Shirt | 24.99 | 1 |
| 4 | USB-C Cable | 12.99 | 0 |
:::

In this Products table, `product_id` is the primary key that uniquely identifies each product.

---

## Foreign Keys

A **Foreign Key** is a column that references the primary key of another table.

::: {style="font-size: 0.5em;"}

**Products Table**

| product_id | name | price | in_stock |
|------------|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Wireless Headphones | 79.99 | 1 |
| 2 | Coffee Beans | 14.99 | 1 |
| 3 | T-Shirt | 24.99 | 1 |

**Orders Table**

| order_id | product_id | customer | qty | completed |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----|-----------|
| 101 | 1 | Alice | 2 | 1 |
| 102 | 2 | Bob | 5 | 1 |
| 103 | 3 | Carol | 3 | 0 |

:::

The `product_id` in Orders references `product_id` in Products.

## MySQL Data Types

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em;"}
| Data Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| INT | Integer (whole numbers) | 1, 100, -50 |
| VARCHAR(n) | Variable length text | 'John', 'hello' |
| DECIMAL(m,n) | Decimal number | 99.99, 19.50 |
| TEXT | Long text content | Descriptions, comments |
| TIMESTAMP | Date and time | 2025-04-13 08:15:00 |
| TINYINT | Small integer (0-255) | 0, 1 (boolean) |
| DATE | Date only | 2025-04-13 |
