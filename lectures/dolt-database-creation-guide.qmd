## Step 1: Create a Dolt Account

Visit [https://www.dolthub.com](https://www.dolthub.com) and click the "Sign Up" button. Fill in your email address and create a password. You'll receive a verification email to confirm your account.

Once verified, you'll have access to all Dolt features including the ability to create and manage databases.

---

## Step 2: Navigate to Your Profile

Once logged in, go to [https://www.dolthub.com/profile](https://www.dolthub.com/profile) to access your dashboard. This is where you can manage all your databases and repositories.

---

## Step 3: Create a New Database

On your profile page, click the **"Create Database"** button. Choose a name for your database (for example: "simple-orders-and-products"). Provide a description if desired, then click **"Create"**.

Your new database will be created and you'll be taken to the database homepage.

---

## Step 4: Create Tables

Once inside your database, click on the **"Tables"** tab. Click **"Create table"** to start defining your first table.

To generate CREATE TABLE queries:
  
- Paste your table descriptions and information into an LLM (like Claude)
- Have the LLM generate the CREATE TABLE queries for you
- Copy the generated SQL statements and paste them directly into Dolt

---

## Step 5: Insert Data

To populate your tables with data:
  
- Prepare your table data (in CSV, list, or table format)
- Paste your table data into an LLM (like Claude)
- Have the LLM generate INSERT statements for you
- Copy the generated SQL INSERT statements and paste them into Dolt

### Example INSERT Statements

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, in_stock) VALUES (1, 'Wireless Headphones', 79.99, 1);
INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, in_stock) VALUES (2, 'Coffee Beans', 14.99, 1);

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_id, customer, qty, completed) VALUES (101, 1, 'Alice', 2, 1);
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, product_id, customer, qty, completed) VALUES (102, 2, 'Bob', 5, 1);
```
:::

---

## Step 6: Query Your Data

Use SELECT statements to view your data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE completed = 1;

SELECT p.name, COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id;
```

## Primary Keys

A **Primary Key** is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Every row must have a unique primary key value, and it cannot be NULL.

::: {style="font-size: 0.75em;"}
| product_id | name | price | in_stock |
|------------|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Wireless Headphones | 79.99 | 1 |
| 2 | Coffee Beans | 14.99 | 1 |
| 3 | T-Shirt | 24.99 | 1 |
| 4 | USB-C Cable | 12.99 | 0 |
:::

In this Products table, `product_id` is the primary key that uniquely identifies each product.

---

## Foreign Keys

A **Foreign Key** is a column that references the primary key of another table.

::: {style="font-size: 0.5em;"}

**Products Table**

| product_id | name | price | in_stock |
|------------|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Wireless Headphones | 79.99 | 1 |
| 2 | Coffee Beans | 14.99 | 1 |
| 3 | T-Shirt | 24.99 | 1 |

**Orders Table**

| order_id | product_id | customer | qty | completed |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----|-----------|
| 101 | 1 | Alice | 2 | 1 |
| 102 | 2 | Bob | 5 | 1 |
| 103 | 3 | Carol | 3 | 0 |

:::

The `product_id` in Orders references `product_id` in Products.

## MySQL Data Types

::: {style="font-size: 0.65em;"}
| Data Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| INT | Integer (whole numbers) | 1, 100, -50 |
| VARCHAR(n) | Variable length text | 'John', 'hello' |
| DECIMAL(m,n) | Decimal number | 99.99, 19.50 |
| TEXT | Long text content | Descriptions, comments |
| TIMESTAMP | Date and time | 2025-04-13 08:15:00 |
| TINYINT | Small integer (0-255) | 0, 1 (boolean) |
| DATE | Date only | 2025-04-13 |
