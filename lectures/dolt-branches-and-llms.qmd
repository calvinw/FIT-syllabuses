## Allowing an LLM to Edit a Database

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}

When working with an LLM it is dangerous to have them editing directly your data sources.

- **LLMs can hallucinate** - they may generate incorrect data or SQL
- **They can make mistakes and misunderstand your prompt instructions** - instructions can be ambiguous
- **It is always smart to use a backup when editing your database** - protect yourself from unwanted changes

## Creating an API Key for the LLM

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}

You can create an API key in Dolt so that you can have an LLM making changes to the database. 

- This is usually called a **write** or **commit Token** and is found under **Settings > Tokens** in Dolt
- Create one of these and save it somewhere secure so that you can give it to the LLM later
- Configure permissions so that it only works on the database you are working on
- Optionally restrict it to only the allowed branch that the LLM will work on

## Creating a Branch for the LLM to Use

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em;"}

In Dolt you can have the LLM make database changes using `write_query` on a dedicated branch. This workflow keeps your main branch safe.

- **Create a branch** in the database for the LLM to do its work on
- **Give the LLM an API key** to write to the database, but only on the branch (not main)
- **Work with the LLM** to do the work on the branch (INSERTS, UPDATES, etc.)
- **Check the work** before committing it to main - review all changes carefully
- **Create a Pull Request** to merge the branch, then merge that request to make changes permanent
