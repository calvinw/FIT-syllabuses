## Example 1 

```r
do some code up here

if this statement is true  
  do this 1st thing  
else if this 2nd statement is true 
  do this 2nd thing  
else  
  do this 3rd thing 
```

## Example 2 

Here == means "is equal to"

```python
x = 3  
if x == 2 
    print("first thing")
else if x == 3
    print("second thing")
else  
    print ("third thing")
```

In words:

```r
set x equal to 3
if x is equal to 2  
    print("first thing")
else if x is equal to 3 
    print("second thing")
else  
    print("third thing")
```
. . . 

"second thing"

## Example 3

Here \< means "is less than"

```python
x = 12  
if x < 10 
    print("first thing")
else if x < 20 
    print("second thing")
else  
    print ("third thing")
```

In words:

```r
set x equal to 12 
if x is than 10  
    print("first thing")
else if is less than 20 
    print("second thing")
else  
    print("third thing")
```
. . . 

"second thing"
