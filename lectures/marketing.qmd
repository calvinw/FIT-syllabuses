## Leads Table {.smaller}

Description: This table is your list of potential customers. It stores the
"who" – any person who has shown interest in your business but hasn't
necessarily bought anything yet. Each lead gets a unique ID.

## Conversions Table {.smaller}

Description: This table links the leads and campaigns tables together. It
records the "action" – which lead responded to which campaign, and when it
happened. The lead_id and campaign_id columns refer back to the first two
tables.
