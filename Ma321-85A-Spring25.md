## Evaluation

Your grade will come from these parts:
Each of these parts is described in more detail below

- Quizzes  (80%)
- In Class/Homework Problems (20%)

### Quizzes

Your quiz grade will come from 5 quizzes roughly covering 2 or 3 weeks material each
This quizzes are 30-45 minutes each and are usually 5 or 6 questions each. These quizzes are with no notes, no internet, no phone, no software, no AI tools. Pen and paper and calculator only. They are some multiple choice, some short answer, some true false. 

### Inclass/Homework Problem Credits (2 or 3 per class)

Problem credits are credits you obtain for demonstrating you have completed assigned problems. Some of these will come from homework assignments that you show me at the beginning of the class, some of these will come from in class assignments that are done during class and you show as you complete them. You will earn 1 credit for each successful problem completion. 

You must be in attendance to earn problem credits.  

There is NO FINAL EXAM.
