# Doing Calculations using the Multiplication Table for $D_3$ 


**Combinng Symmetries of an Equilateral Triangle:**

Sometimes we have a complicated combination of the symmetries $R$ and $F$ we
want to simplify. Simplify means we combine the symmetries or perform the
symmetries  until we are all done. 

It turns out we will wind up with one of these in the end:

$$ \huge{ 1, R, R^2, F, RF, R^2F } $$ 

For example 

$$
\Huge{R^2FRFR} = ? 
$$

If we wanted to find the result by combining the actual symmetries we could do this:

- **Do 2 rotations of 120 counterclockwise, then flip across a vertical line,
then do a rotation of 120 counterclockwise, then do a flip across a vertical line,
then do a rotation of 120 counterclockwise**

and see what we get. 

Whehhh!. Thats exausting.

But we can also do this by using a multiplication table for combining
symmetries. This table tells us how two symmetries in our set combine and turn
into one of the other elements in our set of symmeties.

Here is the multiplication table that tells us how to combine symmetries:


## Multiplication Table for Symmetries of an Equilateral


|  | $\textbf{1}$ | $\mathbf{R}$ | $\mathbf{R^2}$ | $\mathbf{F}$ | $\mathbf{RF}$ | $\mathbf{R^2F}$ |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| $\mathbf{1}$ | $1$ | $R$ | $R^2$ | $F$ | $RF$ | $R^2F$ |
| $\mathbf{R}$ | $R$ | $R^2$ | $1$ | $RF$ | $R^2F$ | $F$ |
| $\mathbf{R^2}$ | $R^2$ | $1$ | $R$ | $R^2F$ | $F$ | $RF$ |
| $\mathbf{F}$ | $F$ | $R^2F$ | $RF$ | $1$ | $R^2$ | $R$ |
| $\mathbf{RF}$ | $RF$ | $F$ | $R^2F$ | $R$ | $1$ | $R^2$ |
| $\mathbf{R^2F}$ | $R^2F$ | $RF$ | $F$ | $R^2$ | $R$ | $1$ |

What the table says is this:

- If you combine an $F$ symmetry with an $RF$ you get the symmetry $R^2$

The way to do it, is to use the table like when you learned to multiply:

- Go to the row with $F$ and go over to the column with $RF$ and you will see the answer

So the table says:

$$ (F)(RF) = R^2 $$ 

Here is another example:

The table says:

$$ (F)(R) = R^2F $$ 

The table says:

$$ (R^F)(RF) = R $$ 


So we 

We want to simplify this until it is one of the 6 elements on this table:

**Example:**

Simplify this:

$$
\huge{R^2FRFR^2FR} = ? 
$$


First we look on the left side of the expression and we group terms into the
biggest chunks we can. 

We can use $1, R, R^2, F, RF, R^2F$ as the elements we chunk together to multiply.

I see that $R^2F$ is on the table, and so is $RF$

This is the biggest "chunking" I could do:


$$
\Huge{R^2FRFR^2FR} = \Huge{(R^2F)(RF)R^2FR}  
$$

(I could chunk like this:

$$
\Huge{R^2FRFR^2FR} = \Huge{(R^2)(F)RFR^2FR}  
$$

or like this:

$$
\Huge{R^2FRFR^2FR} = \Huge{(R^2F)(R)FR^2FR}  
$$

But those are not the most I can take at a time. 

Chunking together as much as possible will get you to the solution more easily.
