# How to Identify a Rosette Pattern

Rosette patterns are either one of these types:

$D_1$, $D_2$, $D_3$,... 

Or they are one of these types:

$C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$,... 

The first set are called *Dihedral* rosette patterns.

The second set are called *Cyclic* rosette patterns.

Every rosette pattern is **exactly one** of these types. 
It cannot be more than one type.

For example if it is $D_2$, then it is not any of the other types. Its just $D_2$ 


## If It Has Reflection Lines Its _Dihedral_

If the pattern has reflection lines it will be a _Dihedral_ pattern. 
You just need to then identify the number of reflection lines.

### This is an example of a $D_1$ (It has 1 reflection line)

### This is an example of a $D_2$ (It has 2 reflection lines)

### This is an example of a $D_3$ (It has 3 reflection lines)

### This is an example of a $D_4$ (It has 4 reflection lines)

That means: If it has reflection lines, *count the number of those* to figure
out which Dihedral pattern it is.

Otherwise...

## If It Has No Reflection Lines Its _Cyclic_ 

If has no reflection lines it will be a *Cyclic*. You just need to identify the
number of motifs it has around the center point to identify it

### This is an example of a $C_1$

Notice it has 1 motif around the center point

### This is an example of a $C_2$  

![](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/symmetry/2.gif)


Notice it has 2 motifs around the center point

### This is an example of a $C_3$  

![](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/symmetry/3.gif)

Notice it has 3 motifs around the center point

### This is an example of a $C_4$  

![](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/symmetry/4.gif)

Notice it has 4 motifs around the center point

### This is an example of a $C_5$  

![](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/symmetry/5.gif)

Notice it has 5 motifs around the center point

# Additional Ideas

## Dihedral Rosettes have Rotational and Reflection Symmetry

## Cyclic Rosettes have Rotational Symmetry Only

## Two Rotations make a Reflection

But notice that because Dihedral rosettes have reflection symmetry
they also have rotations, since 2 reflections make a rotation.

Motifs go from Normal, Inverted, Normal, Etc. for Dihedral Rosettes.

Each jump from Normal to the next Normal around the center is a Rotation.

## Two Mirror Kaleidoscope Designs are exactly the same as the Dihedral Rosettes

The 2 mirror Kaleidoscopes designs you looked at earlier are exactly the same
as the dihedral rosette patterns. This is just another name for 2 mirror
Kaleidoscopes. 

(Here 2 mirror means you make them with 2 real mirrors open at an angle, but
they produce potentially more that 2 reflection lines going around that center
point.)
